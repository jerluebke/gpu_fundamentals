The program tiled_mat_mul compares three algorithms for matrix multiplication:
 1. CPU, Naive
 2. GPU, Naive, using global memory
 3. GPU, Tiled, using shared memory

The algorithms are tested for different matrix sizes and different tile/block
sizes. The CPU code is executed only for small matrix sizes and for only one
tile size (by which it isn't affected).

Both GPU codes performs significantly faster than the CPU code, which is mainly
used to varify the correctness of the resulting matrix. The shared code
performs faster than the global code for all configurations (s/g < 1) and the
gain increases clearly with increasing matrix sizes, which reflects the
performance restriction due to limited memory bandwidth of the global memory.
The optimal tile size is 8x16, except for the intermediate matrix sizes
(1200x400) and (400x2000). The slightly lower gain of the tile size 8x8
probably results from the fact, that this configuration does not achieve full
occupancy on the employed hardware.
