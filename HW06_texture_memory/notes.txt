The program texture compares the effective memory bandwidth of shared and
texture memory for matrix transposition and multiplication. The benchmark
considered setup procedures such as allocation of shared memory and creation of
texture handles.

The previous homeworks showed, that shared memory easiy outperforms naive use
of global memory, since it is not subjected to the limited bandwidth of the
latter. However read-only textures provide a way to utilize global memory with
a performance which is en par with the shared memory algorithms, except for
matrix multiplication with small thread blocks, where doing many allocations of
small areas of memory in parallel is an advantage for the shared memory
algorithm.
